# C++ Projects

This repository houses a variety of projects I have coded in C++. Each project is organized into its own subfolder with source code, build instructions, and documentation.

## About

This repo holds C++ projects I've built while learning the language for practice and experimentation. The projects range from small utilities to more structured applications that demonstrate object-oriented programming and software design principles. Each project has its own folder and includes a Makefile, basic instructions to run and documentation where applicable.

The goals are to improve code quality, deepen my understanding of C++, and provide reusable code examples for others.

## Requirements

- C++11 or later
- A C++ compiler (G++, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- `make` (GNU Make or compatible build tool)
- Optional: Libraries (If a project requires one it will be noted in its folder)

## Usage

See each project's individual `README.md` for usage instructions.

## Projects List

- [Casino Games](./casino-games) - A collection of simple CLI-based casino-style games
- [Currency Converter](./currency-converter) - A simple TTD currency converter
